# meetup-aggregator

Pulls together info for several meetups into a single place. Useful for checking what's already on if you're planning your own event.

The meetup list for Northern Ireland is in [src/meetupList.ts](/src/meetupList.ts) - feel free to PR in more meetups, or just [send me the details](https://github.com/MarkXA).
